## Reason for making this? 💡

> TLDR: To share the characters' story of CHUNITHM to people who could not read Japanese.

Since late 2022, CHUNITHM became playable in countries other than Japan.

The number of international CHUNITHM players have increased since then and some players had some interest in the unique story that each character had.

However, due to the language barrier, Japanese, few were able to understand or enjoy the character's story, which gives another enjoyment of playing CHUNITHM.

To solve this problem I decided to build a service that can convey the characters' story to non-Japanese people, mainly focusing on English and Korean.
